                            Histologics LLC's primary objective is to advance the field of tissue sampling into the
                            21st century. Proper tissue sampling and care during colposcopic practice and other
                            medical settings should serve to save lives, worldwide.

                            Histologics LLC was established in 2008 out of a dedication to women undergoing
                            evaluation for abnormal cervical cancer screening and a need for better histologic
                            sampling. The founders, including Ob/Gyn inventor Dr. Neal Lonky, developed
                            Speculoscopy (PapSure ®) and Spirabrush CX® in the 1980's and early 1990's
                            (respectively). Years of dedication to improving women's healthcare led the company
                            to innovate a different approach to obtain tissue samples from the cervix, lower
                            genital tract, and other epithelium.
